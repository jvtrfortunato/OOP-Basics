Concept of Abstraction in OOP

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), abstraction is a fundamental 
concept that refers to the ability to hide the complex details of 
an implementation and expose only the essential and relevant 
characteristics of an object. Abstraction allows you to work with 
more general and simplified concepts, making it easier to 
understand and manipulate objects within a system.


1. Hiding Details:
What It Is: Abstraction hides the internal details of how an 
object performs its tasks, showing only what is necessary for 
other objects to interact with it.

Example: In a banking system, the operation of "withdrawal" can 
be represented by a method withdraw(). The user does not need to 
know how the withdrawal is processed internally, only that the 
operation can be performed.



2. Interface and Implementation:
What It Is: Abstraction separates the interface (what an object 
does) from the implementation (how an object does it). The 
interface defines the methods that the object can use, while the 
implementation defines the behavior of those methods.

Example: An interface Shape might have methods like 
calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter(). Concrete classes such 
as Circle and Rectangle implement these methods in different 
ways, but the interface ensures that both types of shapes can be 
used consistently.



3. Ease of Modification:
What It Is: By using abstraction, you can modify the internal 
implementation of an object without affecting the code that 
uses the object, as long as the interface remains the same.

Example: If you decide to change how a bank calculates balances, 
you can do so without altering the code that interacts with the 
bank account, as long as the interface methods like 
checkBalance() remain unchanged.



4. Creating Classes and Objects:
What It Is: In OOP, you use classes to define abstractions of 
objects. The class describes the set of attributes and methods 
that the object will have, allowing you to create instances of 
the object based on the abstraction provided by the class.

Example: The Car class might have attributes like model, year, 
and methods like accelerate() and brake(). The Car class 
provides an abstraction for all cars, regardless of their 
individual specifications.



5. Encapsulation:
What It Is: Abstraction is often combined with encapsulation, 
which is the process of hiding the internal details and exposing 
only a public interface. Encapsulation helps protect the internal 
state of objects and ensures they are used in a controlled 
manner.

Example: In a BankAccount class, details of the balance are 
encapsulated and accessible only through public methods like 
deposit() and withdraw(), preventing direct alterations.
Abstraction allows you to work with higher-level concepts and 
interact with objects without worrying about the complex details 
of their internal implementation, making software development 
more modular and manageable.
